  <h1>YMCA Website User Manual</h1>

  <h2>Getting Started</h2>
  <p>
    If you are currently looking at our Welcome screen, press the <strong>Sign In / Register</strong> button in the top right-hand corner to browse and sign up for classes.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you already have an account, enter your username and password on the Sign In screen. If not, click the small text that says <strong>"Sign up here"</strong> to create a YMCA account.
  </p>

  <h2>Creating an Account</h2>
  <p>
    From the registration page, enter all required information including a secure password and your mailing address (used to send fliers).
  </p>
  <p>
    At the "Membership Type" selection:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Member</strong>: Requires a monthly fee, but includes discounted classes and access to special YMCA areas.</li>
      <li><strong>Nonmember</strong>: No monthly fee, but class prices are higher.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    When you're ready, click the <strong>"Create Account"</strong> button (left side). You’ll be redirected to the Browse Classes page.
  </p>

  <h2>Browsing and Registering for Classes</h2>
  <p>
    On the Browse Classes page, you’ll see all available upcoming classes. Read descriptions carefully — some may list prerequisites.
  </p>
  <p class="note">
    Note: The YMCA does not enforce class leveling, but we encourage you to consider your experience and ability before registering.
  </p>
  <p>
    To register, click the blue <strong>"Register"</strong> button next to the desired class. If the button is grayed out, the class is either full or cancelled.
  </p>
  <p>
    After clicking "Register", you'll be shown a confirmation screen with the class time, location, and prices (member vs nonmember). Click <strong>"Confirm Registration"</strong> to finalize your sign-up.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Important:</strong> Billing is handled in person at the YMCA front desk. A receptionist will assist you with payment at that time.
  </p>

  <h2>Managing Your Classes</h2>
  <p>
    After registering, click <strong>"My Classes"</strong> from the top navigation bar (next to "Help") to view your upcoming classes.
  </p>
  <p>
    To cancel a class, click the class entry from the My Classes page, then choose <strong>"Unregister"</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    While we encourage continued participation, we understand conflicts arise. We appreciate your communication.
  </p>

  <h2>Family Accounts</h2>
  <p>
    From the navigation bar, you can click <strong>"Family Account"</strong> to view your linked family members and shared account info.
  </p>
  <p class="note">
    Note: You <strong>cannot</strong> create, add, or delete family members unless logged in with a staff account.
  </p>

  <h2>Logging Out</h2>
  <p>
    When finished, click the <strong>"Logout"</strong> button in the top right, then close the browser window.
  </p>

  <h2>Thank You</h2>
  <p>
    Thank you for using the YMCA website. We’re proud to have you as part of our community — working together for a healthier tomorrow.
